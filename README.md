# SWD Lethbridge

This page is to report results and view standings. It is meant to streamline the league (and so I can practice some Comp Sci)

This site is currently under construction.

## Current Standings

Graph/Chart showing names, points, matches, W, L, other notes
Sort the order by points

## Reults Reporting
This section might be better if contained in a link to a separate page

I need to have input boxes, or even better dropdown menus that will record the raw data (google forms-style)

## Meta picture

If I really get good at this then I will create a section with a look at which decks are victorious
This needs to be anonymous and perhaps only available after a certain # of games, or just before the top cut



//Code

string name;
int p, m, w, l;
